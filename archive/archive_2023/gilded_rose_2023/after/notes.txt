Framework:
1. Analyze - understand how the concepts and code work
2. Goal setting - you need to know what you're doing and when you're done
3. Create safety net - write complete sets of unit tests
4. Refactor step-by-step: 
    - start with simple quality of life
    - intermediate steps
    - go from simple to complex
    - inverting logic
    - split isolated parts in separate functions
    - commit your intermediate steps
5. Measure success (ex. easy to add new types of items)
